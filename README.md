# Shopify Custom Theme - Webnorth Task

This is my submission to Webnorth's technical assessment. In this repo you will find both the front end task and the back end task

## Set up instructions

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have the Shopify CLI installed. Follow the [Shopify CLI installation guide.](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli "See ya in a minute!")

### Run my dev store locally

1. Clone the Repository into your local development environment using the following command:

```git clone https://github.com/OliverHolt/webnorth-shopify-task```

2. Navigate to the directory

```cd olivers-dev-store```

2. Use this command to run my dev store locally:

```shopify theme dev -s pkj1ee-nj```

You should be able to preview my (configured) store and see the theme editor too

Alternatively, you can visit this link: https://pkj1ee-nj.myshopify.com/password
And enter the password 'hejhej'

## Front end task
The homepage will contain a section called 'Featured Products'. In this section you can configure the collection displayed, layout, and display of the gift message (from the back end task) in the theme editor

## Back end task
In this repo, there is a file in the snippets folder called `gift-with-purchase-script`. This file contains the logic that applies this cart rule: when two specific products are added to the cart, a third product is automatically added for free. There is no need for additional set up or installation to see this rule in action.
